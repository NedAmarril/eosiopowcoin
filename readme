EOS PoW Coin (POW) EOS Proof of Work Coin (POW) applies the PoW (Proof of Work) mining schedule and adjusting difficulty of Bitcoin (BTC) [2] to an EOSIO [3] Token.

50 POW are minted every 10 minutes for about 4 years, then the amount minted halves. This will repeat until there are 21 million POW, exactly like BTC.

EOS CPU & NET resources are used to mine POW by transferring EOS to eosiopowcoin. This will result in a refund of that exact amount of EOS plus 0.0025% of the total POW supply in the eosiopowcoin account.

POW is a completely decentralized, open-source project with no developer share or allocation. Anyone can mine POW after using the setuperminer action. POW minting will continue until supply reaches 21 Million.

Proof of Work (PoW) works with EOSIO Blockchain. CPU mining on EOS is PoW mining without the threat of a 51% attack. PoW is the fairest, most decentralized means of distributing and creating new cryptocurrencies.

Use your EOS tokens as blockchain cryptocurrency miners in perpetuity. EOS Tokens don't need power or upgrading to stay competitive against other miners on EOS. The inflation in EOS is your cost of maintenance, electricity, and upgrades. Use your EOS to its full potential instead of letting it go to waste.

Bitcoin pow algo is a religion... a very social outcome.
